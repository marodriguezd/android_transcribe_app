/**
 * Plug-in point for live-subtitle text translation (fork addition). A

 * keeps the original on screen.
 *
 * <p>Contract:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations may be called from any thread; the service serializes
 *       requests and applies results on the main thread in strict FIFO order,
 *       so slow or failing translations never reorder captions.</li>
 *   <li>{@code sourceLanguage}/{@code targetLanguage} are ML Kit language
 *       codes; either may be {@code null}, in which case the implementation
 *       must fall back to the source text.</li>
 *   <li>Never throw: route every failure through
 *       {@link Callback#onFailure(Throwable)} (or the source-text fallback).</li>
